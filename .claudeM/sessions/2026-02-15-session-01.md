## Objectives This Session
- [ ] Full Play Store readiness audit of IDswipe
- [ ] Fix all blockers and production-harden the app
- [ ] Build signed release APK/AAB
- [ ] Create all store listing assets
- [ ] Host privacy policy
- [ ] Install production build on Samsung device

## What Was Accomplished
- Completed comprehensive 4-agent audit: architecture, code quality, Android config, feature completeness
- Fixed 14 code issues: manifest permissions (INTERNET+CAMERA), production signing config, proguard rules, 28 debug prints removed, HTTP timeouts, TextRecognizer resource leak, OAuth null safety, LRU image cache (50 cap), path package dependency
- Generated production keystore (upload-keystore.jks, alias: upload, expires 2053)
- Built signed release APK (112MB) and AAB (112MB) - both verified
- Created feature graphic (1024x500 PNG) and hi-res app icon (512x512 PNG)
- Wrote complete privacy policy HTML with all data practices documented
- Wrote full store listing: short description, full description, data safety responses, keywords
- Created PLAY_STORE_CHECKLIST.md with step-by-step publishing guide
- Hosted privacy policy on GitHub Pages: koller31.github.io/idswipe-privacy
- Uninstalled old debug APK and installed production-signed APK on Samsung (R5CXC1VYACL)
- flutter analyze: 0 errors, 0 warnings (34 info - deprecation only)

## Decisions Made
- Ship IDswipe to Play Store as standalone app + CashSwipe adoption driver
- Use GitHub Pages for privacy policy hosting (koller31/idswipe-privacy repo)
- Production keystore stored at android/upload-keystore.jks with key.properties config

## Blockers / Issues
- User needs to take 4-6 screenshots on Samsung device
- User needs to create contact email for store listing
- User needs to upload AAB + assets to Play Console and fill out forms
