# Session: 2026-02-16 Session 01

## Duration
Started: 8:16 PM
Ended: 8:16 PM

## Objectives This Session
- [ ] Fix gallery import causing auto-lock/activity recreation
- [ ] Get mock IDs onto phone for screenshots
- [ ] Continue Play Store readiness

## What Was Accomplished
- Enabled gallery import in edge_detection (canUseGallery: true)
- Pushed MockIDFront.png and MockIDBack.png to phone via ADB
- Added auto-lock grace period system (suppressLockFor with 2-min window) for camera/gallery/OAuth flows
- Fixed Android Activity recreation bug: added alwaysRetainTaskState to manifest + session persistence in AuthProvider (5-min secure storage window survives activity kill)
- 4 APK rebuilds and installs to iterate on the fix
- Privacy policy live at koller31.github.io/idswipe-privacy

## Decisions Made
- Use time-based grace window for auto-lock suppression instead of one-shot flag
- Persist auth session in FlutterSecureStorage with 5-min expiry to survive Android activity recreation
- Enable gallery import permanently (was disabled with canUseGallery: false)

## Blockers / Issues
- Testing if gallery import works without lock screen interruption

## Handoff for Next Session
