## Full Description (4000 chars max)

IDswipe turns your phone into a secure digital wallet for all your identification cards. Scan your driver's license, employee badge, insurance card, or any ID -- and carry them encrypted on your device, ready to present whenever you need them.

YOUR IDs, YOUR DEVICE, YOUR CONTROL

Unlike cloud-based solutions, IDswipe stores everything locally on your phone. Your cards are encrypted with AES-256 military-grade encryption and never leave your device. No accounts to create. No data uploaded to servers. No tracking.

SCAN AND STORE
Point your camera at any card and IDswipe captures a crisp, edge-detected image. The app automatically reads text from your card using on-device OCR and organizes it into smart categories -- ID Cards, Memberships, Insurance, Gift Cards, Traffic Documents, and more.

PRESENT WITH CONFIDENCE
When someone needs to see your ID, pull it up instantly. IDswipe boosts screen brightness so barcodes scan perfectly. For driver's licenses, the app formats the back-of-card barcode for scanners to read directly from your screen.

NFC BUSINESS BADGES
Connect to your company's badge system and tap your phone at NFC readers -- just like a physical badge. IDswipe supports Host Card Emulation (HCE) so your phone becomes your badge.

LOCKED DOWN SECURITY
- AES-256 encrypted storage for all card images
- PIN and biometric (fingerprint/face) authentication
- Auto-lock when you switch apps
- Screenshot and screen recording blocked
- Secure file deletion (data is overwritten, not just deleted)
- Root/jailbreak detection warning

ORGANIZE YOUR WAY
- Sort cards into categories
- Search across all your cards
- Quick-access recent cards
- Card and document viewing modes
- Customize with free themes

TRAFFIC DOCUMENT MODE
Need to show your registration or insurance at a stop? Lock your screen to the document -- the officer can view it without accessing anything else on your phone.

BUSINESS CONNECTIONS
Connect securely to business identity providers via OAuth. Your company issues you a digital badge that works with NFC readers and displays your employee profile.

PRIVACY FIRST
- No internet required for core functionality
- No accounts, no sign-ups
- No analytics or advertising
- All processing happens on your device
- You own your data completely

IDswipe is built for people who want the convenience of digital IDs with the security of keeping everything under their own control.
